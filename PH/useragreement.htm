        <p>To ensure the best possible experience for all group members, we have established some basic guidelines for participation. 
            Please take time to familiarize yourself with these important guidelines.</p>

            <li>Do not share anything that is not relevant to the group's purpose.</li>
            <li>Do not post commercial comments publicly. Contact the person directly with product and service information if you believe it would help them.</li>
            <li>Do not discuss prices, salaries, benefits, fees, specific business transactions, or individual companies, and in particular do not defame, disparage, 
                or criticize any person or company.</li>
            <li>There must be no agreements on prices, salaries, benefits, fees, allocation of markets, or boycotting of any person or company.</li>
